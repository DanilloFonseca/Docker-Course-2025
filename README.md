# Fullstack Project with Node.js, MongoDB, and Vue.js  

This fullstack project was developed by me to demonstrate, in practice, how to containerize a fullstack application using Docker. It includes:  

- **Database connection** with MongoDB  
- **API development** using Node.js  
- **Frontend consumption** of the API with Vue.js  

## Running the Project  

1. Navigate to the project's root directory, where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located.  
2. Run the following commands:  

```sh
docker compose build
docker compose up
